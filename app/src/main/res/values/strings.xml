        \tWelcome to my ResumeApp! Take a peak at some of my previous work, and try to keep an eye
        on the app\'s behaviour. I tried my best to implement as many UI/UX tricks I\'ve learned
        throughout the months (with moderation of course.)\n\n\tIf you like what you see, you\'ll
        find all my credentials at the Contact Page!

        \tI am a student at the University of Toronto who will be graduating this June with a major
        in Human Biology, a major in Pharmacology &amp; a minor in Computer Science.\n\n\tI started
        to transition from the Life Sciences to Software Engineering when I was challenged to build
        a calculator on Minecraft for Xbox. This was an understandably arduous task considering I
        did not know any binary code, logic gating, or even of the Coding Block that existed on the
        PC version of the game!\n\n\tTo keep a long story short, I made a very rough first draft
        that could only calculate 1+2, 1+3 or 2+3. After improving upon my design by building an
        extendable \"skeleton\" that could sum any distinct positive integer, I decided to take
        \"Computer Science for the Life Sciences\" (CSC120) &amp; the rest is history!
