            \tWelcome to my ResumeApp! Take a peak at some of my previous work, and try to keep an
        eye on the app\'s behaviour. I tried my best to implement as many UI/UX tricks I\'ve learned
        throughout the months (with moderation of course.)

    <string name="overview_message">
            \tI am a student at the University of Toronto who will be graduating this June with a
        major in Human Biology, a major in Pharmacology &amp; a minor in Computer Science.

            \n\n\tI started to transition from the Life Sciences to Software Engineering when I was
        challenged to build a calculator on Minecraft for Xbox. This was an understandably arduous
        task considering I did not know any binary code, logic gating, or even of the Coding Block
        that existed on the PC version of the game!

            \n\n\tTo keep a long story short, I made a very rough first draft that could only
        calculate 1+2, 1+3 or 2+3. After improving upon my design by building an extendable
        \"skeleton\" that could sum any distinct positive integer, I decided to take \"Computer
        Science for the Life Sciences\" (CSC120) &amp; the rest is history!
