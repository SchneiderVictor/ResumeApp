        \tWelcome to my ResumeApp! Take a peak at some of my previous work, and try to keep an eye
        on the app\'s behaviour. I tried my best to implement as many UI/UX tricks I\'ve learned
        throughout the months (with moderation of course.)\n\n\tIf you like what you see, you\'ll
        find all my credentials at the Contact Page!
